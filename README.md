# Image-Grid-App
An App to load images from URL and show in collection view grid using Native iOS.

MVC architecture has been used to build this application. URL of images will be seperated from a general URL and then load inidividually in Grid App. Inorder to avoid frequent network calls, Cache has been used to store and retrive the images that already fetched. Thus Memory loading and performance haas been improved.
